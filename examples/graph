This document demonstrates how a graph can generated with python and inserted
into the PDF document. See the Makefile for what commands must be run.
    The &BEGIN and &END lines are instructions for inline_script.py, the
enclosed text is passed to the program stated after &BEGIN.

Here is the graph:

&BEGIN python3
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

file_name = 'graph.jpg'

fig,ax = plt.subplots()
x = np.linspace(0,10,100)
y = np.sin(x)
ax.plot(x, y)

plt.savefig(file_name)
print(f'!IMAGE {file_name}')
&END

The rest of the document can continue as normal.
